# THE CUTTING ROOM — WEEKLY TRACKS
## A personal narrative system where your week becomes a story

---

## Updated Concept

The Cutting Room is an interactive storytelling application where users build a weekly chain of posts called a Track.

Instead of a feed, each user creates a sequence of connected moments.  
Each moment is a node.

A node contains:
- one photo OR one text
- an optional caption
- a system-generated 1-sentence recap

The system connects each node to:
1) the user’s previous node
2) visually or semantically similar posts from other users

Over time, a user’s week becomes a structured narrative rather than a timeline.

At the end of the week, the system generates a story describing:
- what their week was about
- how it relates to other people’s experiences

The user is not writing a diary.

The system writes a story about their life patterns.

## Core Mechanics

### Daily Posting (Limited)
Users can create up to:
3 nodes per day

Each upload:
- 1 image OR 1 text entry
- optional caption
- optional “why this mattered” short phrase

This constraint forces meaningful posting rather than spamming.

---

### Node Creation

Each new node automatically links to:

1) Previous Node (Personal Continuity)
Creates a personal narrative chain.

2) Similar Community Nodes
Found using embedding similarity across all users.

node -> embedding -> nearest neighbors (kNN)

This allows:
private experience + collective parallel experiences

---

### Auto-Generated Recap

Every node receives a **one-sentence recap** generated by the system.

The recap is not a caption.

It is a narrative reflection.

Example:

User post:
Photo of empty train platform

System recap:
“You kept moving but avoided arriving.”

These are randomly phrased from structured prompts to prevent repetition.

---

### Weekly Track

All nodes created in a week form a Track.

Track structure:
Node 1 → Node 2 → Node 3 → ... → Node N

Visible only to:
- the user
- their approved friends (max 40)

This makes it social but intimate.

---

## Weekly Story Generation

At the end of each week the system generates:

### Personal Story
A 5–8 sentence narrative describing:
- behavioral patterns
- emotional shifts
- recurring imagery

### Social Reflection
The system also compares your track to others during the same week.

It identifies:
- shared moods
- opposite trends
- collective behaviors

Example output:

“Your week revolved around waiting — stations, hallways, and unfinished spaces.
While you stayed indoors, many others moved toward open places and sunlight.
Your track suggests hesitation, but the community moved toward exposure.”

This fulfills the “users feel part of the narrative” requirement.

## Embedding System

We convert every post into a semantic vector.

Text:
embedding(text)

Image:
image caption -> embedding(caption)

Stored in database.

Purpose:
- find similar posts
- detect patterns
- generate narrative

---

## Similarity Matching

For each new node:

knn = nearest_neighbors(new_embedding, k=5)

We attach:
- 1–2 similar posts from other users
- never show identity by default

This creates indirect shared storytelling.

---

## Recap Generator

Each node generates a one-sentence recap using structured prompting.

Input:
- current node content
- previous node embedding distance
- neighbor similarity

Prompt idea:

Write one reflective sentence describing the transition between two moments in a person’s life.
Do not summarize the image literally.

This ensures narrative tone.

---

## Weekly Narrative Engine

At week end:

1) Collect user nodes
2) Order chronologically
3) Extract themes
4) Compare to global cluster themes
5) Generate story

We generate:

NarrativeState:
- dominant mood
- change across week
- relation to others

Then LLM writes:
- Personal story
- Community comparison

## Database Design (MongoDB)

Users
_id
username
friends[]
weekly_tracks[]

Nodes
_id
user_id
content_type
content_url or text
caption
embedding[]
previous_node_id
neighbor_node_ids[]
recap_sentence
created_at

Tracks
_id
user_id
week_start
node_ids[]
personal_story
community_story

---

## UI Behavior

Personal Page:
- shows weekly chain as connected nodes
- visual timeline graph

Friend View:
- can read weekly story
- can react/comment

Community:
- similar nodes appear anonymously

Visual direction:
- light theme
- soft colors
- hand-written style elements
- not high-tech aesthetic

---

## Limits (Important Design Constraint)

3 posts/day max
40 friends max

These constraints:
- prevent feed addiction
- encourage intentional posting
- create narrative pacing

---

## How This Fits the Hackathon Prompt

The prompt:
“Create an interactive application that tells a compelling, immersive story and makes users feel part of the narrative.”

This system does that because:

Users do not just read a story.
Their behavior becomes the story material.

Their choices:
what they photograph
when they post
what they repeat

directly change the narrative output.

The story emerges from interaction, not from prewritten content.
